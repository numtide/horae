## Notes

- Re-validated 2026-10-28 after the default-week clarification (16/16).
  - FR-012 now has an expected outcome: the current aligned week, with no
    indicator for pending approvals in other weeks.
  - Whether Harvest has such an indicator stays recorded as unverified, not as
    an open requirement.
- The week-membership clarification names code symbols as provenance for code
  evidence. It is not a requirement.
