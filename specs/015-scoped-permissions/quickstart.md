# Permission verification

## Foundation (no database)

From this worktree:

```sh
nix develop --command cargo test -p horae-core permissions
nix develop --command cargo test -p horae-core
nix develop --command cargo clippy -p horae-core --all-targets -- -D warnings
nix fmt -- --ci
```

The evaluator is not connected to application authorization yet. A green core suite is not evidence of six-profile or approval parity.

### Foundation evidence (2026-09-30)

- RED: the focused test command failed with unresolved scope types before implementation (exit 101).
- GREEN: `cargo test -p horae-core` through the Nix shell passed all 121 tests, including six new permission tests. The coverage table exercises 16 scope combinations against 12 resource cases.
- `cargo clippy -p horae-core --all-targets -- -D warnings` through the Nix shell passed.
- `nix fmt -- --ci` passed after normalizing Markdown code fences; `git diff --check` passed.
- No database, browser, application integration or full-flake validation is claimed for this isolated foundation. Runtime guards, role types and schema are unchanged.

### Incremental analysis

The foundation contract covers FR-006 record union, identity activation and organization isolation, with explicit limits for capability resolution, locks and freshness. No foundation contract inconsistency was found. Full-feature gaps remain: FR-002's operation matrix, FR-015's exact custom dependency/lifecycle contract, FR-019's remaining reference edge cases, and FR-014's reviewed migration/governance. All twenty functional requirements map to the required later work packages in `tasks.md`, but those packages are not yet a complete executable runtime plan. The requirements checklist remains 12/16; no full-story or outcome acceptance is claimed.

## Full-feature acceptance (pending implementation)

The [current access inventory](contracts/current-access.md), [Harvest evidence register](contracts/harvest-evidence.md) and [observed profiles](contracts/reference-profiles.md) now guide the remaining checks. Browser configuration/source inspection is not a substitute for saved-permission enforcement tests.

1. Complete the documented/observed parity matrix and confirm custom dependencies using disposable Harvest fixtures.
1. Exercise each profile and custom configuration through direct server calls, screens, exports, API, jobs and downloads; verify redacted payloads and cross-organization denial.
1. Revoke authority between preview, execution and download; race revocation against mutation and concurrent administrator changes.
1. Submit mixed-project dates, approve only A, verify B remains pending and approved empty cells reject new entries. Exercise filters, another approver, self-approval settings and scoped/whole-week withdrawal against independent locks.
1. Verify custom-template deletion preserves grants, migration preserves records and import/identity linking never overwrites privileges.
1. Verify Settings/Workspace themes, keyboard, narrow/short viewports and enlarged text; run database integration tests and the full flake gate before merge.

## Independent approval tenant-isolation repair

Run PostgreSQL with the repository development stack and migrations applied. Tests use SQLx-created throwaway databases; the database role needs `CREATEDB`.

```sh
nix develop
process-compose up postgres migrate
# In a second development shell, with DATABASE_URL pointing to that stack:
cargo test -p horae --features server --bin horae server_fns::approvals:: -- --nocapture
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --features server --all-targets
SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo clippy -p horae --features server --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Evidence from 2026-09-30:

- Tests invoked the actual approval/reopen transactions. Before adding tenant filters, three isolation tests failed: foreign approval returned, bulk returned two tenants, and foreign reopening succeeded. The same-org invoice-lock preservation case passed.
- After the correction, all 14 approval-module tests passed, including existing submission concurrency tests and four new isolation tests.
- SQLx preparation completed against a separate development database on port 55415. Generated cache entries replace the obsolete query hashes; no application data or migrations changed.
- Server/all-targets Clippy passed with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` and warnings denied. Formatting and diff whitespace checks passed.
- Existing same-org whole-week semantics and bulk skip/count behavior are retained. Scoped project/date approvals, atomic full-selection policy and transactional permission revocation remain pending; this repair does not claim those outcomes.

The browser preview on port 8092 and the user's Harvest account were not changed by these database tests. The whole feature remains draft; no full-flake or end-to-end permission acceptance is claimed here.

## Independent assignment isolation and revocation repair

Using the same isolated PostgreSQL stack:

```sh
cargo test -p horae --features server --bin horae server_fns::projects::assignment_tests::
cargo test -p horae --features server --bin horae server_fns::projects::
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --features server --all-targets
SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo clippy -p horae --features server --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Evidence from 2026-09-30:

- RED: four tests failed against the extracted production SQL: foreign assignment creation, foreign removal, stale administrator admission and failure to wait for concurrent revocation. The same-org lifecycle test passed before the fix.
- GREEN: all five assignment tests passed; all 63 project-module tests then passed, including existing privacy, bulk-action and lifecycle regressions.
- Complete SQLx regeneration passed: five new cache entries replace one obsolete query. Server/all-targets Clippy passed with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` and warnings denied; `nix fmt -- --ci` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Creation validates both project and person organization. Removal returns no foreign/malformed assignment data and preserves those rows. Missing/repeated removal remains an idempotent no-op for an authorized administrator.
- Both mutations reload and lock the active administrator until transaction commit. The concurrency test observes an actual PostgreSQL lock dependency, commits demotion and checks that the waiting mutation fails with `FORBIDDEN`; it does not rely on sleeps.
- No profile, schema, CSS or existing data migration is included. Current administrator-only assignment authority is preserved. Full assignment parity, schema provenance, other entry-point revocation and HTTP/plugin end-to-end checks remain separate work.

The initial incremental SQLx preparation omitted cached integration-test queries even with `--all-targets`. Regeneration disables incremental compilation so the complete target set emits query metadata; do not commit the incomplete intermediate cache.
