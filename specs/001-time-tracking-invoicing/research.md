# Phase 0 Research: Time Tracking & Invoicing

The spec is intentionally implementation-free; this document records the technical decisions that turn it into a buildable plan. Most were already pinned by the constitution and the existing codebase — captured here with rationale and the alternatives considered.

## Decision: Dioxus fullstack, single crate, feature-gated

- **Decision**: One `horae` app crate with `server` and `web` feature targets (three `cfg`-gated `main()`s), plus a pure `horae-core` library crate. All data mutations go through Dioxus `#[server]` functions on an Axum server.
- **Rationale**: Shared Rust types across client and server; type-safe calls without hand-written REST plumbing; `dx serve` builds both targets with hot reload. Isolating correctness logic in `horae-core` keeps totals testable without I/O.
- **Alternatives considered**: Separate Axum REST backend + standalone Dioxus SPA (the original architecture sketch) — more explicit boundary but more boilerplate and duplicated types; rejected in favor of the fullstack model already in the tree. A non-Rust frontend — rejected (loses shared types, single-language goal).

## Decision: Authentication via OIDC + session, with a dev bypass

- **Decision**: Production auth is OIDC (`openidconnect`); a `DEV_LOGIN=1` flag enables a one-click seeded-admin login for local development. Sessions are cookie-based, stored in Postgres (`tower-sessions` + `tower-sessions-sqlx-store`). Authorization is role-based (admin/manager/member).
- **Rationale**: Self-hosted operators typically already run an identity provider; delegating authentication avoids owning password storage/reset/MFA in a small tool. The dev bypass keeps local iteration fast.
- **Alternatives considered**: Local email + password (argon2id), as sketched in `PLAN.md` — reasonable and still compatible with the spec (which is auth-mechanism-agnostic, FR-001), but superseded by OIDC to avoid credential-management burden. Retained as a possible future local-auth mode; the spec's Assumptions leave the mechanism open.

## Decision: Exact time and money representation

- **Decision**: Durations stored as **integer minutes**, money as **integer minor units (cents) + ISO 4217 currency code**; all rounding/totalling done in `horae-core`. UUID v7 primary keys.
- **Rationale**: Guarantees SC-002/SC-007 (totals reconcile exactly) and FR-023; floats accumulate rounding error. v7 IDs are time-ordered for natural sorting and index locality.
- **Alternatives considered**: Floating-point hours/amounts — rejected (drift). Arbitrary-precision decimals — unnecessary given fixed minor units; adds dependency weight to `core`.

## Decision: Sandboxed WASM plugins via extism

- **Decision**: Plugins are WASM modules loaded at startup by `extism`. Each ships a `plugin.toml` (name, version, subscribed hooks). The host exposes a fixed set of capabilities (`horae_log`, read-only `horae_db_query`, `horae_http_post`, `horae_config_get`). On a business event, the registry dispatches to all subscribed plugins concurrently; results are isolated and time-bounded. Plugins may return a structured dashboard-widget spec.
- **Rationale**: WASM gives language-agnostic authoring and a strong sandbox by default (FR-020); extism provides ergonomic host functions and PDKs. Concurrent dispatch with timeouts satisfies FR-021 and SC-006 (never block the core action).
- **Alternatives considered**: Native dynamic-library plugins — full host access, no sandbox; rejected (FR-020). Raw `wasmtime`/WASI — viable but reimplements the host-function/PDK ergonomics extism already provides. Out-of-process webhooks only — less capable, no in-process widgets.

## Decision: No timesheet-approval workflow in v1

- **Decision**: Billable, un-invoiced time is directly invoiceable; there is no submit→approve gate before billing in this feature.
- **Rationale**: Matches `PLAN.md` and keeps the MVP focused (spec Assumptions). The schema keeps room for a richer entry lifecycle later (an `entry_state` enum can add `submitted`/`approved` without migration churn), and an "approvals" surface may be layered on in a future feature.
- **Alternatives considered**: Full approval lifecycle now (as early scaffolding hinted at) — deferred to avoid scope creep; revisit via a follow-up spec.

## Decision: Persistence, migrations, packaging, CI

- **Decision**: PostgreSQL 15+ via `sqlx`; migrations in `crates/horae/migrations/*.sql` applied by `horae migrate run` (and eagerly on `serve`). Exports use `csv`/`rust_xlsxwriter`. Toolchain and builds via Nix (`fenix` toolchain, `numtide/blueprint`), formatted by `treefmt`, checked by `nix flake check` (formatting + a NixOS e2e VM test).
- **Rationale**: Postgres is pinned by the constitution; sqlx gives async access and optional compile-time query checking. Nix gives reproducible dev shells, packages, and a deployable NixOS module.
- **Alternatives considered**: SQLite — explicitly excluded by the constitution for Phase 1. An ORM (SeaORM/Diesel) — rejected in favor of sqlx's explicit SQL and migration model.

## Decision: Invoice & document rendering via Typst

- **Decision**: Render invoices (and later timesheets/report PDFs) with **Typst**, from a customizable `.typ` template. Fonts are sourced from nixpkgs so any typeface is embeddable and the build stays reproducible. The invoice's editable fields (provider identity, bank details, notes, line adjustments) feed the template, and the manager can review/adjust them before finalizing/sending (FR-025).
- **Rationale**: Typst is deterministic — the same invoice yields byte-identical output — which extends the exactness principle (Constitution I) from numbers to documents. It is WASM-friendly (consistent with the Dioxus/WASM stack and the sandboxed-plugin direction), has excellent typography, and pulls fonts from nixpkgs for reproducible packaging. The feature plan pins `typst` for PDF (fallback `printpdf`). The approach is proven by [eureka-cpu/nvoice](https://github.com/eureka-cpu/nvoice) (Harvest-exporter JSON → one PDF per client), which is directly reusable because Horae already exposes Harvest-shaped data.
- **Alternatives considered**: `printpdf` — low-level, no templating; kept only as the documented fallback. `rust_xlsxwriter` — spreadsheets only (already used for XLSX export), not documents. Headless HTML→PDF (browser engine) — non-deterministic and a heavy runtime dependency; rejected.

## Resolved unknowns

No `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers remained in the spec. The five open scope questions were settled with documented defaults in the spec's Assumptions (single-org, self-hosted, credential/role auth, no v1 approval workflow, per-client currency) and are reflected in the decisions above.
