# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Claude Code and others) when working with code in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

Horae is a self-hostable time tracker (a Harvest/Kimai alternative) built as a Rust + [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) fullstack app (SSR + WASM) on PostgreSQL/Axum.

## Precedence

- Follow repository documentation and checked-in project conventions first.
- Use the guidance in this file when the repository does not specify an alternative.
- Treat `Prefer` as a default choice, not an absolute rule.
- Treat `Use` and `Do not` as stronger instructions.

## Commands

Work inside the Nix dev shell; a running PostgreSQL is required for anything touching the database.

```sh
nix develop            # dev shell: rust toolchain, dx (dioxus-cli), sqlx-cli, postgres, process-compose
process-compose up     # the dev stack: postgres + the app on :8080, migrated and seeded
nix run .#dev          # the same thing without entering the shell first
```

`process-compose up` is the normal way to run things locally. It starts PostgreSQL as a plain
process, waits for it to accept connections, then runs `dx serve`. Database state lives in
`.data/postgres` (gitignored) and persists across restarts — `rm -rf .data` is the reset button.
Migrations are applied before the app is built — sqlx checks its query macros against the
live database at compile time, so an unmigrated database fails to compile, not to run — and
the demo seed runs once on an empty database. The TUI shows per-process logs; `process-compose down` stops everything.

pgweb runs alongside it at http://localhost:8081 for browsing and querying the database.
To start only part of the stack, name the processes: `process-compose up postgres migrate`
gives you a database on its own, for `cargo test` or for running `dx serve` yourself.

Connection details live in the `environment` block of `process-compose.yaml` and nowhere
else — change the port or user there and every process follows.

`nix run .#postgres` still boots a NixOS VM running PostgreSQL (forwards host :5432, :2222).
Use it to exercise the NixOS module — not for day-to-day work.

`DATABASE_URL` defaults to `postgres://localhost/horae`; the dev shell exports
`postgres://horae@127.0.0.1:5432/horae`, which both options above serve.

### Build & run

The app crate lives at `crates/horae/` (the repo root is a virtual workspace). It is **feature-gated** — `crates/horae/src/main.rs` has three `cfg`-selected `main()`s, and default features are empty. Always pick a feature or use `dx`, and select the crate with `-p horae`:

```sh
cargo build -p horae --features server          # server binary + CLI
cd crates/horae && DEV_LOGIN=1 DATABASE_URL=… dx serve   # dev server (dx runs where Dioxus.toml is), hot reload on :8080
cargo run -p horae --features server -- <subcommand>     # run the server binary directly
```

CLI subcommands: `serve`, `migrate run`, `migrate reset --confirm`, `seed`, `user list`, `user create --email … --name … --role …`.

These are for one-off tasks; `process-compose up` covers the normal run loop. Open
http://localhost:8080/auth/login and "Sign in as Admin" (needs `DEV_LOGIN=1`, which the stack sets).

### Test & lint

```sh
cargo test -p horae-core                        # pure domain unit tests (no DB, no features)
DATABASE_URL=… cargo test -p horae --features server     # integration tests (need Postgres with CREATEDB)
DATABASE_URL=… cargo test -p horae --features server <name>   # a single test
cargo clippy -p horae --features server
nix fmt                                         # treefmt: rustfmt, taplo, nixpkgs-fmt, mdformat
```

Integration tests (`crates/horae/tests/integration.rs`) use `#[sqlx::test]` — each spins up a throwaway database, so the DB role needs `CREATEDB` — and are marked `#[serial]`. `nix build` builds the package; `nix flake check` runs the formatting check plus a full NixOS e2e test.

### sqlx query cache

All SQL queries use compile-time checked macros (`sqlx::query!`, `sqlx::query_as!`, `sqlx::query_scalar!`). These validate SQL against the database schema at compile time, catching typos, type mismatches, and schema drift before the code runs.

At compile time, macros need either `DATABASE_URL` pointing to a live DB with migrations applied, or `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` with the `.sqlx/` cache committed to the repo. Nix builds use `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`.

After changing any `query!`/`query_as!`/`query_scalar!` macro or migration, regenerate the cache:

```sh
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --features server --all-targets   # requires live DB with migrations applied
git add .sqlx/                                        # commit the updated cache
```

**Important:** the `--features server` flag is required because all sqlx query macros live behind `#[cfg(feature = "server")]`. Without it, `cargo sqlx prepare` finds zero queries and **deletes** the entire cache.

For custom PostgreSQL enum types, use type overrides in the SQL:

- **Columns**: `state as "state: EntryState"` in SELECT
- **Parameters**: `EntryState::Open as EntryState` in macro arguments
- **Optional filters**: `($N::type IS NULL OR column = $N)` pattern with `Option<T>` parameters

## Architecture

**One app crate (`crates/horae/`), two build targets, feature-gated.** `crates/horae/src/main.rs` defines three `main()`s behind `cfg`: `server` (Axum + Tokio + the CLI), `web` (`dioxus::launch`, compiled to WASM), and a stub that errors if neither feature is set. Server-only modules (`auth`, `cli`, `config`, `db`, `harvest`, `reports`, `seed`, `state`) are `#[cfg(feature = "server")]`; the shared UI modules (`app`, `route`, `pages`, `components`, `server_fns`, `models`, `error`) compile for both targets. This is why a bare `cargo build`/`test` (empty default features) won't do what you expect.

**The `core` crate (`horae-core`) is pure domain logic** — duration parsing, rounding, money, totals, the entry state machine — with no I/O dependencies (only serde/uuid/chrono/thiserror). Correctness-critical code belongs here and is unit-tested in isolation; SPEC.md §1 forbids sqlx/axum/dioxus deps in `core`.

**The server layers custom Axum routes on top of the Dioxus fullstack router** (`Commands::Serve` in `main.rs`): it calls `.serve_dioxus_application()`, then `.merge`s `/health`, CSV/XLSX export (`reports.rs`), the auth router (`auth::router()`), and the read-only Harvest-compatible API (`harvest::router()`, `/harvest/v2/*`), all under a Postgres-backed session layer. So there are **two API surfaces**:

- Dioxus `#[server]` functions in `server_fns.rs` — session-authenticated; the SPA uses these for all mutations.
- Plain Axum routes — health, exports, auth, and the read-only Harvest v2 API.

**Shared state**: `state.rs` holds a global `AppState` in a `OnceCell`, initialized once at startup with the `PgPool`; server fns and auth read from it. The pool is created and migrations applied eagerly on `serve`.

**Auth**: production uses OIDC (`openidconnect`); `DEV_LOGIN=1` enables a one-click admin login that bypasses OIDC (see `auth/`). Sessions are cookie-based, persisted in Postgres.

## Domain invariants (from SPEC.md — do not violate)

- Durations are stored as **integer minutes**; money as **integer minor units (cents) + ISO currency code** — never floats.
- Primary keys are **UUID v7** (time-ordered).
- **PostgreSQL only** (no SQLite). Migrations live in `crates/horae/migrations/` and apply via `sqlx` / `migrate run`.
- Single organization for now, but every table keeps an `org_id` FK so multi-org is a later flip.

`SPEC.md` is the authoritative Phase-1 build spec (schema, milestones, API contract). `DESIGN.md` is the design system (Invoicer aesthetic; tokens in `crates/horae/assets/css/horae.css`; components are one-per-file `#[component]` functions using `use_signal`/`use_resource`, with no global mutable UI state).

## Skills

The repo ships agent skills in `.agents/skills/` (surfaced to Claude Code through `.claude/skills/` symlinks). Invoke the relevant one before the matching task — they carry conventions this project relies on:

- **`rust-best-practices`** — idiomatic Rust from Apollo's handbook: borrowing vs cloning, `Result`/error handling, performance, and the sqlx compile-time-macro and module-layout rules this repo follows. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Rust.
- **`rust-testing`** — unit, integration, async, and property-based testing patterns (TDD). Use when adding or changing tests; pairs with the `#[sqlx::test]` / `#[serial]` setup under *Commands → Test & lint*.
- **`rust-async-patterns`** — Tokio, async traits, and concurrency patterns. Use for async server code or when debugging async behaviour.
- **`ponytail`** — enforces the smallest solution that works (YAGNI, stdlib before deps, one line before fifty). Use on any coding task, especially before adding a dependency or abstraction.

A `speckit-*` suite (`specify`, `plan`, `tasks`, `implement`, `analyze`, `checklist`, `clarify`, `constitution`, `converge`, `taskstoissues`) supports spec-driven development against `SPEC.md`.

## Conventions

### General

- Write for readers of the final code, not for the diff.
- Prefer simple, direct code over clever or overly compact code.
- Keep changes scoped to the task. Avoid incidental refactors unless they are necessary to make the change safe or understandable.
- Prefer minimal diffs that solve the problem clearly.
- Preserve existing naming, formatting, and architectural patterns unless there is a clear reason to change them.
- Comments should explain why, constraints, or non-obvious tradeoffs, not restate what the code already says.
- Do not leave comments that describe the editing process or previous instructions from the conversation.
- When referring to code, reference stable symbols or files rather than line numbers. Line-number references go stale quickly.

### Project-specific (from code review)

Rules on top of idiomatic Rust (see the `rust-best-practices` skill). These come from code review — follow them so the same notes don't recur:

- **Named status codes, not integer literals.** When building `ServerFnError::ServerError { code, .. }` in `server_fns.rs`, use named constants (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`, `FORBIDDEN`) rather than bare `404`/`403`, so error paths read at a glance.
- **Avoid `Option<bool>` parameters.** `Some(false)` is ambiguous at the call site. For a two-state flag on a server function, prefer a plainly named `bool` with an obvious default, or a small purpose-named enum.
- **New modules use the `foo.rs` + `foo/` layout, not `foo/mod.rs`.** A multi-file module lives in `foo.rs` (the module root) beside a `foo/` directory of submodules — as `pages`, `models`, `components`, and `server_fns` already do. `mod.rs` is *not* deprecated (the Rust Reference keeps both forms working), but the Reference encourages the sibling-file form and it keeps the tree free of many identically-named `mod.rs` files. The remaining `auth/mod.rs`, `harvest/mod.rs`, and `plugin/mod.rs` predate this rule; convert them opportunistically, not in unrelated PRs.

## Repository Hygiene

- Write commit messages, branch names, PR titles, PR bodies, and issue comments as a human developer would in any repository.
- Do not mention AI assistance, model names, model versions, or references that are not appropriate for the repository.
- Do not use `Co-Authored-By` lines or other attribution that reveals AI involvement.
- Describe only the user-visible change, bug fix, refactor, or implementation detail relevant to the repository.
- Good examples:
  - `Handle missing config file during startup`
  - `Add validation for empty API responses`
  - `Simplify cache invalidation logic`
- Bad examples:
  - `Generated with an AI assistant`
  - `Tested with model-x experimental build`
  - `Sync changes from internal-tooling branch`
  - `Co-Authored-By: AI Assistant <assistant@example.com>`
